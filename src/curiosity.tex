As many people, I place some of my early memories during my time in elementary school, and similarly to many, such memories are not particularly the most enjoyable ones. It was the time where differences where notorious, misunderstood, and punished. In a german school during the late 80's, where discipline and uniformity was still a first value, I learned the hard way to defend my position on the left side of this equations: 

curiosity = disobedience
curiosity = commitment to struggle % Deconstructing the status quo against an institutionalized system of meaning making.
curiosity = insubordination

Quoting Aristotle, "all human beings, by nature, desire to know". That was in fact the opening line of his work Metaphysics, highlighting curiosity as a fundamental aspect of human nature.  However, I experienced that curiosity, as a "distracted learning style", is often rejected as a vicious form, as oposed to a virtuous one. Aristotle did actually have an incline to recommend being studious about one thing (monopragmosyne). Even Plato argueed before that curious people suffer from an imbalance in the 3 parts of their soul: reason, spirit and appetite. \citep{perry}

It bacame well established that being curious implies taking risks, fail, make mistakes, "die at least a few times". \citep{foucault1980masked} Foucault reflects on the transformative power of curiosity, suggesting that it involves letting go of established ways of thinking and being open to change, which he metaphorically describes as a form of “dying.”

% I believe the 3dr equality also comes from M. Foucault. maybe from "Discipline and Punish"
