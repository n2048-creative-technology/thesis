Whenever I take a walk, I don't just stroll from A to B. I'm constantly monitoring every obstacle, every moving object and person around, everything that can be moved by the wind or shifted by the weight of raindrops. I calculate the next position of every object, adjusting my trajectory to account for the space needed for myself and my companion, when there's one by my side. I walk, and I am in the near future as much as I am in the present—more than most people I've discussed this with.

I observe what everyone else sees, and I analyze the changes in their motion patterns and facial expressions, curiously attempting to predict their intentions, possible thoughts, and probable actions. I play out their actions in my mind like a game of chess. I'm here and now, yet I am also everywhere before and after. I'm everyone in my own form, simultaneously avoiding and seeking connection.

The brain’s "signal detector" operating in an overly sensitive state, amplifies both real and perceived threats. Constant monitoring, responsiveness, attention to subtle changes, amplified details that go often unnoticed.
