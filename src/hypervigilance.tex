Whenever I take a walk, I don't just stroll from A to B and enjoy the views. I'm constantly monitoring every obstacle, every moving object and person around, everything that can be moved by the wind or shifted by the weight of raindrops. I calculate the next position of every object, adjusting my trajectory to account for the space needed for myself and my companion, when there's one by my side. I walk, and I am in the near future as much as I am in the presentâ€”more than most people I've discussed this with.

I observe what everyone else sees, and I analyze the changes in their motion patterns and facial expressions, curiously attempting to predict their intentions, possible thoughts, and probable actions. I play out their actions in my mind like a game of chess. I'm here and now, yet I am also everywhere before and after. I'm everyone in my own form, simultaneously avoiding and seeking connection.
