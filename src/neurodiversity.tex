I spent the last years of my life understanding what this means to me. I learned about the mask I put on unknowingly — to fit in, to attract less attention, to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings. I learned the consequences of wearing this mask. The idea of perception as a controlled hallucination suggests that what we see, know, and understand is no more than the most likely prediction made by our trained brains. A neural network in which an internal conflict arises between an error signal—indicating that what’s in front of us does not match our expectations—and a massively skewed training dataset of memories, insisting that what we know from past experiences is the correct interpretation.

Neurodivergence is now better known and understood, but as a statistical minority, it is not well represented in the dataset of human interactions. It is only logical that it would be difficult to comprehend from the perspective of a neurotypical brain. The issue of skewed datasets is commonly addressed in the context of AI and machine learning. However, while we can design datasets to balance the represented populations, a real brain learns from real interactions, and the statistics remain the same regardless of awareness.

Analytical acceptance, algorithmic forgiveness.
