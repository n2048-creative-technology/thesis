I learned about the mask I put on unknowingly to fit in, to attract less attention, to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings. I learned the consequences of wearing this mask.

Living often feels like running an emulation program, replicating behaviors and responses that come naturally to others. On the surface, the emulated environment mimics a typical operating system, seamlessly performing tasks and following expected protocols. 

The effort to conform to neurotypical standards can be exhausting, often overwhelming and disconnecting.

The tension between imitation and authenticity mirrors the challenges of emulation. Like an emulator replicating the functionality of another system, masking often relies on recombining observed behaviors to navigate social environments. But emulation, by its nature, exposes the limits of replication, revealing deeper truths through interaction and engagement.

In his essay \textit{The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction}, Walter Benjamin describes the uniqueness of a piece as its \textit{aura}, and argues that mechanical reproduction diminishes the aura of an original work of art, affecting its authenticity \citep{benjamin1935}. 

The rise of digital art and AI technologies further complicates the discussion on authenticity. In the digital realm, the ease of replication and distribution encourages a reevaluation of authenticity. The available tools contradict, or at the very least challenge the traditional criteria for what constitutes an original piece, and the notion of what adds value. 

Large language models, or \textit{LLMs} offer a powerful example of emulation, imitating human-like language and creativity while simultaneously challenging traditional notions of originality and authenticity.

LLMs are trained on gigantic datasets of text. They calculate probabilities of possible words and generate text that mimics human communication, often indistinguishable from content created by real people. LLMs emulate linguistic styles, cultural idioms, and intellectual processes by identifying patterns in existing data. 

Through prompt engineering, users collaborate with LLMs to refine outputs, curating their emulation capabilities. This interplay demonstrates how AI tools can enhance human creativity while raising questions about the nature of authenticity. If authenticity lies in human origin, AI lacks it. But if authenticity is somehow measured based on the audience's experience, then LLM-generated texts can feel authentic, even when created by non-human systems.

Deeper connections can be found between AI emulation and human cognition. Both systems recombine existing information to create something new. The distinction lies in intent: human thought is driven by curiosity, emotions, and purpose, which add layers of meaning that is (currently) absent in AI's mechanical processes.

Masking similarly involves effortful emulation. By adapting to environments shaped by neurotypical norms, masking suppresses natural tendencies to conform to expected patterns. This raises questions about the boundaries between imitation and authenticity in human interactions. Am I authentic if my responses are carefully curated and contextually appropriate but lack an intrinsic connection to the emulated behaviour?

Ultimately, whether in art, technology, or human behavior, the interplay between imitation, emulation, and authenticity challenges us to consider the deeper meanings behind our actions and the layers of intent that define who we are.
