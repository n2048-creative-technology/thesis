\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Emulation}

Living often feels like running a sophisticated emulation program on a computer. On the surface, the emulated environment mimics a typical operating system, seamlessly performing tasks and following expected protocols. However, behind this facade of normality, a complex system is working overtime to replicate behaviors and responses that come naturally to others. Constantly striving to appear organized, focused, and in control, while internally grappling with distraction, impulsivity, and a torrent of unfiltered thoughts.

Just as an emulated system can lag or crash when overloaded, I become overwhelmed and fatigued by the continuous effort to conform to neurotypical standards. The emulation requires immense mental resources, leading to burnout and a sense of disconnection from my authentic self.
