% This chapter talks about influences of the unknown on anxiety. 

Anxiety is proportional to the entropy of a situation. 


\subsection*{ Entropy, quantum mechanics and Sudoku solving} 

The algorithmic way to solve a sudoku puzzle, is to find the cells 
that present minimum entropy. 
This means, find the cells where the number of possible options is smaller.
When a possible solution is presented to this cell, the cells around them will 
in turn decrease their entropy. 

According to quantum mechanics, the wave function represents the probabilities 
of different coexisting realities, that is, until a 
measurement is made. At the moment of measurement, chance is replaced by 
actuality. The wave function collapses, and reality is set.

Every unknown in life, every decition still not made, creates a multitude of 
posibilities, a distribution of paralel potential realities, simultaneously 
existing in a high entropy state. 

Making a decision, or a discovery, will collapse all posibilities into one, 
reducing entropy and in consecuence reducing the asociated anxiety for the unknown.
